# README for Happiness Dataset Analysis

## **1. Project Overview**
- **Dataset Name**: `happiness.csv`
- **Dataset Description**: This dataset provides insights into the subjective well-being of individuals across various countries. It includes measures of happiness, including factors like economic performance, social support, and life expectancy. Data is aggregated from numerous sources, capturing various dimensions that contribute to an individual's perceived happiness.
  
- **Summary Statistics**:
  - **Total Features**: 11
  - **Total Records**: 2363
  - **Data Types**: Numerical (10), Categorical (1)

## **2. Data Cleaning Process**
- **Missing Data**: Missing values in the dataset were assessed, revealing that several critical columns contained missing data exceeding 10%. The following actions were taken:
  - **Country Name**: Dropped missing values to maintain dataset integrity.
  - **Year**: Dropped any rows missing this essential field.
  - **Life Ladder, Log GDP per Capita, Social Support, Healthy Life Expectancy at Birth, Freedom to Make Life Choices, Generosity, Perceptions of Corruption, Positive Affect, Negative Affect**: Imputed using the median method to minimize bias and retain data volume for analysis.
  
- **Outliers**: Outlier analysis was performed on numerical features, particularly:
  - **Life Ladder, Log GDP per Capita, Social Support, Healthy Life Expectancy at Birth, Freedom to Make Life Choices, Generosity, Perceptions of Corruption, Positive Affect, Negative Affect** exhibited extreme values. These were likely influenced by economic disparities across countries, societal constructs, or inaccurate reporting. While these outliers provide insights, they may skew analytical metrics if not treated correctly.

- **Formatting Changes**: Standardization of data types was performed for consistent analysis. For instance, ensuring all categorical variables were uniformly categorized, and numerical features were formatted to appropriate decimal places.

## **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- **Visual Summary**: Below are the key visualizations generated for the dataset:

  1. **[Correlation Heatmap](./correlation_matrix.png)**: 
     - Significant correlations were observed:
       - Life Ladder positively correlates with Log GDP per Capita (0.86) and Social Support (0.75).
       - Generosity showed a weaker correlation with Happiness (Life Ladder) at -0.68.

  2. **[Box Plot for Outliers](./outlier_boxplot.png)**: 
     - Notable outliers were identified in:
       - Life Ladder and Log GDP per Capita, indicating a few countries with much higher or lower values than the rest.

  3. **[Missing Values Heatmap](./missing_values_heatmap.png)**: 
     - Columns with missing values include Log GDP per Capita, Life Ladder, and others with missing data ranging from 5% to over 25%.
  
  4. **[Histograms of Numerical Features](./numerical_histograms.png)**:
     - Features like Positive Affect and Freedom to Make Life Choices exhibited right skewness, indicating fewer countries report low values.

## **4. Key Insights**
- **Feature Importance**: 
   - Life Ladder emerges as a strong predictor of happiness, heavily influenced by economic factors such as GDP and social connections.
  
- **Data Quality**: 
   - Data inconsistencies due to missing values and outlier presence were evident, which may affect analytic conclusions, marking the need for pre-processing before modeling.

- **Patterns & Trends**: 
   - A significant trend observed is that wealthier countries report higher levels of happiness. Moreover, societal support mechanisms play a crucial role in enhancing well-being.

## **5. Recommendations**
- **Data Preparation**: 
   - Future data cleaning could incorporate advanced imputation techniques, such as KNN imputation, and conduct a thorough review of outliers to determine their legitimacy.
  
- **Modeling Tips**:
   - Multicollinearity in highly correlated features should be addressed, possibly through feature selection methods like PCA.
   - Feature scaling, such as Min-Max scaling, could be beneficial prior to any model training.
  
- **Feature Engineering**: 
   - Creating new features, such as ratios (e.g., GDP to population) or log transformations of skewed features, could enhance predictive power and model performance.
